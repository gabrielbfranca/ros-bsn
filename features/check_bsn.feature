	Scenario: BSN-P12 If the BodyHub has processed data, it will eventually detect the patient's new health status.
		Given the Target System Data topic is online
		When I listen to topics:
			| Topic Name         |
			|  thermometer data   |
			|  ecg data          |
			|  Target System Data  |
		Then sensors will process the risks
		And Target System Data will receive the risks from sensors and detect patient's status

	Scenario: BSN-P09 If data has been sent by the sensor node, the BodyHub is able to process it
		Given the Target System Data topic is online
		When I listen to topics:
			| Topic Name          |
			| thermometer data    |
			| ecg data            |
			| Target System Data  |
		Then sensors will process the data
